Risk reduction experiment 1:

Goal: simulate cloud-Raspberry Pi video communication to avoid "risk" of incompatability.
- Simulate Raspberry Pi with a local Python server that provides an endpoint for 10 second video.
- Simulate cloud with a local Node server that requests video from Pi and displays it.
- Fallback: if video communication not feasible, at least transfer serial data.
- Soft deadline: Nov 6
